Brandon, I like there's a highlighted lines around the buttons "Select" and "Exit" on Form1 and also the "Back" and "Exit" buttons on the
StateDetails form. The comments on both forms are present along with orginazed code. However, there isn't a comment with your name and
file name was partially met.

Once running the program, the program showed a Microsoft Visual Studio Message saying, "There were build errors. Would you like to continue
and run the last successful build?" with a "Yes" and "No" option. I clicked the "No" option because of fear of crashing my personal 
computer.

Overall, your presentation of each of your forms look very promising and inseresting even without testing the assignment. Along with the
codes as well. However, I do wonder why there is two buttons, "View All States" on each of the forms. Additionally, I notice three errors
on lines 5, 11, and 16 since it's not connected to the StateDataLib and haven't been found base on the Solution Explorer.
